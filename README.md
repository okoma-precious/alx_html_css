# 🎧 ALX Headphones Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Frontend Curriculum**. The goal is to recreate a pixel-perfect and fully responsive landing page from a professional Figma design — using only **HTML and CSS** (JavaScript allowed only at the last stage).

## 📐 Project Objective

- Replicate a web page exactly as designed in Figma
- Practice clean semantic HTML and structured CSS
- Focus on responsive design, accessibility, and visual accuracy
- No use of frameworks or libraries (pure HTML & CSS)
- JavaScript only allowed in the final hamburger menu task

## 🎨 Design Source

- Final Figma design: [Open in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/qmG6yLNk4U6pTXnPpLB3lt)
- Fonts used: `Source Sans Pro`, `Spin Cycle OT` (download from Figma or Google Fonts)
